# Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher – Encryption · Decryption · Attack

This C++ project implements a **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher** system that supports encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis (attack) via frequency analysis.

---

##  Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts plaintext using a fixed, user-defined monoalphabetic key.  
- **Decryption**: Converts ciphertext back to plaintext using the same key.  
- **Cryptanalysis (Attack)**: Attempts to break the cipher using **frequency analysis** when the key is unknown.

---

##  Requirements

- **Programming Language**: C++ (any modern standard, e.g., C++11+)  
- **IDE / Compiler**: Code::Blocks, GCC, Clang, or any C++ compiler  
- **Platform**: Works on Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
